# Roadmap

This document outlines the planned development for the n8n Pterodactyl Node. This roadmap is subject to change based on community feedback and priorities.

## Current Status

‚úÖ **v1.0.2 - Published & Available** (October 2025)

All essential Pterodactyl Panel operations are implemented and published:

- Server Management (5 operations)
- File Operations (8 operations)
- Database Management (4 operations)
- Backup Operations (6 operations)
- Account Management (6 operations)

**Total: 29 operations across 5 resources**

**Package Status:**
- ‚úÖ Published on npm: [n8n-nodes-pterodactyl](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-pterodactyl) v1.0.2
- ‚úÖ Passes n8n security scanner
- ‚ö†Ô∏è n8n Community Nodes verification: **LOW PRIORITY** (requires demo video, package works perfectly on dedicated n8n)

## Completed Milestones

### ‚úÖ Tier 1: Publication & Distribution

- ‚úÖ Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD
  - Automated testing on pull requests
  - Automated npm publishing on releases
  - PR validation (Validate PR, Test, Claude Code workflows)
- ‚úÖ Publish to npm registry (v1.0.0 Oct 2, v1.0.1 Oct 2, v1.0.2 Oct 3)
- ‚úÖ Fix n8n verification blocker (removed setTimeout for rate limiting/retry)
- üîÑ Submit to n8n Community Nodes catalog - **On hold** (low priority, requires demo video)

## Next Up: Tier 2
