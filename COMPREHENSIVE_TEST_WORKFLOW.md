## Node Naming Convention

### Pattern: `[API]: [Resource] → [Operation] ([Type])`

**Examples:**
- `App: User → List` - Simple list operation
- `App: User → Get (DROPDOWN)` - Operation with dropdown
- `App: Nest → Get Egg (DEPENDENT)` - Dependent dropdown
- `App: Node → Delete Allocation (CRITICAL)` - Critical test case
- `Client: Database → Rotate Password (NESTED DEPENDENT)` - Nested dependency
- `Client: Schedule → Update Task (3-LEVEL DEPENDENT)` - 3-level dependency
- `WS: Server Control → Set State (DROPDOWN)` - WebSocket operation

**Type Indicators:**
- `(no suffix)` - No dropdown fields
- `(DROPDOWN)` - Has independent dropdown
- `(MULTI-DROPDOWN)` - Has multiple independent dropdowns
- `(DEPENDENT)` - Has single-level dependent dropdown
- `(NESTED DEPENDENT)` - Has 2-level dependent dropdown
- `(3-LEVEL DEPENDENT)` - Has 3-level dependent dropdown
- `(CRITICAL)` - Critical test case with complex dependencies

---

## Testing Notes Embedded

Each node includes testing notes in the `notes` field:

### Independent Dropdowns
```
"notes": "TEST: Select user from dropdown"
```

### Dependent Dropdowns
```
"notes": "TEST: 1) Select nest, 2) Wait for egg dropdown, 3) Select egg"
```

### Critical Multi-level
```
"notes": "TEST CRITICAL: 1) Select user, 2) Select nest → egg dropdown populates,
3) Select egg → docker image dropdown populates, 4) Select node → allocation
dropdown populates, 5) Select allocation"
```

## Test Execution Strategy

### Phase 1: Basic Operations (No Dropdowns)
Test all operations that don't require dropdowns:
- Account operations (email, password, API keys)
- Create operations (user, location)
- External ID lookups

### Phase 2: Independent Dropdowns
Test all simple dropdown operations:
- Get operations (user, location, node, nest, server)
- Single-field dropdowns
- WebSocket operations

### Phase 3: Single-Level Dependencies
Test dependent dropdowns:
- Node → Allocations
- Nest → Eggs
- Client → Server-based operations

### Phase 4: Nested Dependencies
Test 2-level dependencies:
- Server → Database
- Server → Backup
- Server → Schedule
- Server → Allocation
- Server → Subuser

### Phase 5: Critical Multi-Level
Test complex dependency chains:
1. **App: Server → Create** (MOST CRITICAL)
2. **App: Server → Update Startup**
3. **App: Node → Delete Allocation**
4. **Client: Schedule → Update Task**
5. **Client: Schedule → Delete Task**

### Phase 6: WebSocket & Trigger
Test real-time operations:
- All WebSocket operations
- WebSocket Trigger node

## Expected Test Results

### Dropdown Functionality
- ✅ All dropdowns should populate with entity lists
- ✅ Entity names should display with identifiers
- ✅ Empty states should show helpful messages
- ✅ Error states should display user-friendly messages

### Dependent Dropdown Behavior
- ✅ Child dropdowns should be empty/disabled until parent selected
- ✅ Selecting parent should automatically trigger child refresh
- ✅ Changing parent should clear and refresh all children
- ✅ Multi-level chains should cascade correctly

### Critical Multi-Level Tests
- ✅ **Server → Create**: All 6 dropdowns should populate in correct order
- ✅ **Server → Update Startup**: Egg selection should populate docker images
- ✅ **Node → Delete Allocation**: Node selection should populate allocations
- ✅ **Schedule → Task operations**: 3-level cascade should work smoothly

### API Compatibility
- ✅ All Application API operations work with numeric IDs
- ✅ All Client API operations work with string identifiers
- ✅ All WebSocket operations use Client API credentials
- ✅ WebSocket Trigger activates and monitors events

## Usage Instructions

### Loading the Workflow

1. Open n8n web interface
2. Click **Workflows** in sidebar
3. Click **Import from File**
4. Select `test-workflows/comprehensive-pterodactyl-test.json`
5. Click **Import**

### Configuring Credentials

**Two credential types required:**

1. **Pterodactyl Application API**
   - Used by: Application API nodes
   - Fields: Panel URL, API Key (application)

2. **Pterodactyl Client API**
   - Used by: Client API nodes, WebSocket nodes, WebSocket Trigger
   - Fields: Panel URL, API Key (client)

### Executing Tests

**Option 1: Manual Execution (Recommended)**
- Open each node individually
- Verify dropdown functionality
- Execute node
- Check results

**Option 2: Workflow Execution**
- Not recommended due to lack of connections
- Workflow is designed for node-by-node testing

**Option 3: Section-by-Section**
- Test one section at a time
- Use sticky notes as guides
- Mark checkboxes in results checklist

---

## Maintenance

### Adding New Operations

When new Pterodactyl operations are added:

1. **Determine section**: Which resource does it belong to?
2. **Create node**: Follow naming convention
3. **Position node**: Use appropriate X,Y coordinates
4. **Add notes**: Include testing instructions
5. **Update checklist**: Add to results sticky note
6. **Update count**: Increment operation totals

### Updating Dropdown Patterns

If dropdown patterns change:

1. **Test critical operations first**: Server → Create, Update Startup
2. **Update operation notes**: Reflect new behavior
3. **Verify all dependency levels**: Independent → Nested → Multi-level
4. **Document changes**: Update this file

---

## Known Limitations

### Workflow Execution

**No node connections:**
- Workflow is designed for **individual node testing**
- Operations are **independent** and **not chained**
- This is **intentional** for thorough testing

**Why no connections:**
- Allows testing operations in any order
- Prevents cascading failures
- Enables selective operation testing
- Facilitates dropdown behavior verification

### Credential Management

**Manual credential entry:**
- Each node requires credential selection
- Credentials are not pre-filled in JSON
- Users must configure on first use

**Why manual:**
- Credentials are environment-specific
- Security best practice
- Allows testing with different credentials
