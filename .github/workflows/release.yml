name: Release

# This workflow generates releases from conventional commits
# Workflow relationship:
#   1. release.yml (this) -> Creates version bump, CHANGELOG, and git tag
#   2. publish.yml -> Triggered by tag push -> Publishes to npm + GitHub Release
#
# Trigger strategy: Manual only to avoid creating releases for non-feature commits
# Run this workflow manually from Actions tab when ready to release
